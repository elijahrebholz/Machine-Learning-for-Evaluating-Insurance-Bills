A predictive algorithim using a dataset which holds information about patients, and their insurance costs. 
There are 1338 instances, all with the parameters of: Sex, Age, BMI, Number of Children (including 0), Smoking Habits, and Residential Region. 
The output is the prediction of the costs in medical bills. 
Overall, the model can predict the costs, evaluate it’s internal models and methods, and readjust it’s weighting to increase its accuracy every iteration, giving the most accurate information possible.
Five different types of models are used, in order to determine the best possible outcome.
The models used are: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, a Neural Network, and a KNN model.
